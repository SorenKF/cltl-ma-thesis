\item fill in the appropriate fields (name, title, etc.) in \texttt{mathesis.tex};
\item fill in the file stubs in the \texttt{tex} folder: \texttt{abstract.tex}, \texttt{acknowledgments.tex}, etc.
\item replace \verb|bib/example.bib| by your own \texttt{bib} file(s);
\item and anything else needed to make this template your thesis. All the best!
\end{itemize}
