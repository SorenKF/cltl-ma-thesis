# CLTL MA Thesis template 

This repository provides a MA thesis template, with tips on project and bibliography management.

## Files

The main latex file (and the only one that needs compiling) is `mathesis.tex`.

* the template relies on the class `mathesis.cls`, the style files `mathesis.sty` and `matitle.sty` and the VU logo, `VUlogo.png`; 
* the files `bib/example.bib` and `tex/tips.tex` are only needed for the ground version of the template;
* the template refers to a number of standard files in `./tex`: `abstract.tex`, `declaration.tex`, etc. Modify or add your files according to your needs.
